- 6x 5mm 4-pin Common-Cathode RGB LED
- 6x 3-pin 2.54mm pitch DIP switch
- 6x 3-pin 2.54mm pitch SPDT switch
- 6x B103 10kOhm slide potentiometer
- 1x Arduino Nano (USB-C variant recommended)

Note: The following resistor values may vary depending on the LED manufacturer.
They were found empirically to balance each color to roughly equal brightness.
- 6x 5kOhm resistor (for red channels)
- 6x 30kOhm resistor (for green channels)
- 6x 9kOhm resistor (for blue channels)
